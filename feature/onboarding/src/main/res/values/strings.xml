    <string name="onboarding_description_app">This app is an appendix to the wonderful website https://1001albumsgenerator.com/\n\nThe app is a hobby project, where I wanted to show the daily albums cover art on the home screen, because I like cover art.\n\nThe actual app is not as feature complete as the website, so use it as you will, but I recommend using the widget.</string>
